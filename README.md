# tweet_analysis

We have created a Twitter Sentimental Analyser as a web application which would analyze whether tweets regarding a topic are of positive, neutral or negative sentiment on the social media platform. We aim this to do using the python library tweepy and using twitter api keys which will help us get the necessary real time tweets.
